   <h1 class="font-style2">font-family: "Pacifico", cursive; </h1>
   <h3>About:</h3>

   <p>Aloha! Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011. It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen in 2016. It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at Lettersoup in 2017.

    The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from Vernon Adams, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA</p>

   <h1 class="font-style3" > font-family: "Space Mono", monospace;</h1>
   <h3>About:</h3>
   <p>Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.

    Developed for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s (See: Microgramma, Eurostile), many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.
    
    Typographic features include old-style figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, center-height and cap-height currency symbols, directional arrows, and multiple stylistic alternates.
